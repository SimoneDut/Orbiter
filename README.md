This projects requires "SDL2.dll", "SDL2_ttf.dll, "SDL2_image.dll, "SDL2_mixer.dll", "libfreetype-6.dll", "libpng16-16.dll", "zlib1.dll" under Windows.

Controls:
- 'Z': MANUAL mode
  - '1', '2', '3' and '4': control each engine individually using 50% of thrust.
  - Arrows: accelerate the orbiter left/right/up/down with a combined action of different engines.
  - ',' and '.': accelerate the orbiter counterclockwise/clockwise with a combined action of different engines.
- 'X': GOTOREST mode, the orbiter goes back to its rest position.
- 'C': ORBITMOUSE mode, the orbiter orbits around the mouse.
- 'D': enable/disable data; if enabled, it shows the target for the orbiter in GOTOREST and ORBITMOUSE modes, and the power of each engine as a percentage.
- 'S': enable/disable sound.
